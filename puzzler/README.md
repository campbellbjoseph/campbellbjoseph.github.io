*** To-dos:***

- Implement better buttons for home page and add default value (~1 hour)
- Update difficulty functionality to consider number of "gimmie" clues (i.e. 2x1 cells that are in the same row or column as a 1x1) (~3 hours)
- Add more complex features (0, modulo, exponentiation, etc.) (~3 hours)
